KDTree2
=======

KDTree2 is an example of how to implement a [KDTree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree "K-d_tree") in C#.  My implementation includes a demonstration of using bounding sphere search and bounding box search.  

Features
========
* BoundingBox search
* BoundingSphere search
* Simple Wavefront .obj Read/Write support... VERY SIMPLE.
